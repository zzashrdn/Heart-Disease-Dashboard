# Exploratory Analysis of Heart Disease Risk

## Project Overview
This project presents an exploratory data analysis of heart disease risk factors using an interactive Power BI dashboard. The objective is to identify patterns and relationships between patient characteristics and the likelihood of heart disease.

The dashboard highlights key risk factors such as cholesterol level, chest pain type, age distribution, and overall disease prevalence to support data-driven insights.

## Dataset
- **Source:** Heart Disease dataset (commonly used for predictive and analytical studies)
- **Records:** 270 patients
- **Key variables:** Age, cholesterol, chest pain type, heart disease status, exercise angina, blood pressure, and more

---

## Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI**
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**
- Data grouping & calculated measures
- Interactive slicers and KPI cards

---

## Key Insights
- Chest pain type shows the strongest differentiation in heart disease risk.
- Heart disease cases peak among patients aged approximately 55–65.
- Cholesterol levels show relatively consistent heart disease rates across groups in this dataset.
- Overall heart disease prevalence is approximately **44%** of the total population.

## Dashboard Features
- KPI cards for total patients, cases, and disease rate
- Risk comparison by chest pain type
- Age-based distribution of heart disease cases
- Interactive filters for exploratory analysis
